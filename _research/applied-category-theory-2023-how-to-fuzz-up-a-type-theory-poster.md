During the Applied Category Theory 2023 conference, I presented a poster detailing the results of a year of continued research from my "Fuzzy Type Theory for Opinion Dynamics" group from the Adjoint School 2022, headed by Paige North. This poster can be found [below](https://github.com/sjboc/sjboc.github.io/blob/0b23d11b37a2f842154baf3442aaa9e8a45f7897/files/how_to_fuzz_up_a_type_theory.pdf), and it details our strategy of determining the form of an "enriched dependent type theory" by enriching the categorical semantics of dependent type theory and reading out the syntax from the resulting enriched categorical semantics.
