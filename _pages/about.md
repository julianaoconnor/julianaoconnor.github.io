Hello! I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University with a focus on Programming Languages. At the moment I am particularly interested in Homotopy Type Theory and the fields adjacent to it, including type theory as a whole, constructive mathematics, and computer formalization/proof assistants. I am also currently participating in two research projects, one focused on category theory/type theory and the other focused on graph theory.
