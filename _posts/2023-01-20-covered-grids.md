I want to share a fun problem I don't know how to solve! I discovered it a few years ago, but I only got a few partial results. It also has some neat implications Iâ€™ll talk about later!

Test:

$ 3 + 4 x = 8 $

<script type="text/tikz">
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) circle (1in);
  \end{tikzpicture}
</script>
