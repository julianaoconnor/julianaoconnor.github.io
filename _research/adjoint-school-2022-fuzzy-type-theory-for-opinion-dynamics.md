During the spring and summer of 2022, I participated in the Adjoint School 2022 as part of the Fuzzy Type Theory for Opinion Dynamics group headed by Paige North. So far this has resulted in a [talk](/talks/2022-07-20-act-fuzzy-type-theory/) I gave and a [blog post](/posts/2022/07/adjoint-school-2022/) I helped write. We are planning on continuing this line of inquiry in the coming months. The link to the Adjoint School 2022 website can be found [here](https://adjointschool.com/2022.html).
