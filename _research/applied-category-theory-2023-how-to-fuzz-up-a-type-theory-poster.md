During the Applied Category Theory 2023 conference, I presented a poster detailing the results of a year of continued research from my "Fuzzy Type Theory for Opinion Dynamics" group from the Adjoint School 2022, headed by Paige North. This poster can be found [below](https://github.com/sjboc/sjboc.github.io/blob/0bff2b7d491ed4da256dbd5508d0a6cc0dc1ef80/files/how_to_fuzz_up_a_type_theory.pdf), and it details our strategy of determining the form of an "enriched dependent type theory" by enriching the categorical semantics of dependent type theory and reading out the resulting syntax.
