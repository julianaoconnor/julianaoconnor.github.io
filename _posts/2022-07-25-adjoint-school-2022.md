A blog post I wrote with [Ana Luiza Tenório](https://sites.google.com/ime.usp.br/analuizatenorio) as part of the Adjoint School 2022 program, titled "Learning to Lie with Sheaves". A link to the blog post on the n-Category Café can be found [here](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2022/07/learning_to_lie_with_sheaves.html).
