Hello! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University majoring in mathematics and computer science. At the moment I am particularly interested in Homotopy Type Theory and the fields adjacent to it, including type theory as a whole, constructive mathematics, and computer formalization/proof assistants. I am planning on applying to PhD programs this coming cycle, in the fall of 2022.
